# Linear-Regression---Practical-Example
### Dataset Name: Vehicle Pricing Dataset

### Description:
This dataset contains information about various vehicles, including their brand, price, body type, mileage, engine specifications, registration status, and manufacturing year. It is designed for practical examples and exercises related to linear regression analysis.

### Columns:

Brand: The make or brand of the vehicle (e.g., BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi).
Price: The price of the vehicle (in unspecified currency). This is the target variable for linear regression.
Body: The type of vehicle body (e.g., sedan, van, crossover).
Mileage: The total distance the vehicle has traveled, typically measured in kilometers.
EngineV: The engine volume or capacity, measured in liters.
Engine Type: The type of engine (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Gas).
Registration: Whether the vehicle is registered (yes or no).
Year: The year the vehicle was manufactured.
Model: The specific model of the vehicle.

### Usage:

This dataset is intended to be used for linear regression analysis, where the goal is to predict the price of a vehicle based on other features such as mileage, engine volume, and year of manufacture. It can be used to demonstrate concepts such as feature selection, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of regression results.

### Data Notes:

The dataset contains 4,345 entries.
Some rows have missing values in the Price and EngineV columns, which might require data cleaning before analysis.
